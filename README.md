# REST API

This project mainly uses Sequelize and Express to read and display database data through a REST API. User can use Postman to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) the data in the database.

Setup instructions:

-Download repository

-Run "npm install" to install dependencies

-Run "npm run seed" to create the database populate with data or use existing db file in root: fsjstd-restapi

-Run "npm start" to connect to server localhost:5000

Using the Postman application, import RESTAPI.postman_collection to run various tests on the routes.
The tests allow you create, read, update, and delete the data in the database.
